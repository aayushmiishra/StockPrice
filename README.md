Google Stock Price Prediction using LSTM 
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict Google stock prices based on historical data.

Project Overview
Uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM layers to model time-series data.
Trained on Google stock price data using past 60 days of "Open" prices.
Predictions are visualized and compared to actual stock prices.
